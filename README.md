## Roadmap stages

 RCE is a distributed, workflow-based integration environment. Engineers and scientists use it to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites). The Multidisciplinary-design Adaptation and Sensitivity Toolkit (MAST) is a sensitivity-enabled, multiphysics FEA tool developed to support computational design and engineering analysis. DrivAerNet++ covers all conventional car designs. CARS is a dedicated and open source 3D tool to produce Digital Surface Models from satellite imaging by photogrammetry. Archimedes is a free and open source CAD (Computer Aided Design) software. Manyfold is an open source, self-hosted web application for managing a collection of 3d models, particularly focused on 3d printing. Open Source Circuit Board Design Software that runs on the browser and desktop. CADmelia is an open-source CAD tool for creating 3D CAD models. Chili3D is an open-source 3D CAD software that runs directly in modern web browsers. CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models. CADCloud is a cloud based sharing infrastructure dedicates to CAD engineers. The FreeCAD MCP (Model Control Protocol) provides a simplified interface for interacting with FreeCAD through a server-client architecture. MechatronicUML is a Model-Driven Software Development tool-chain for cyber-physical systems. Mechatronic is a Workbench for FreeCAD that allows the modification of parametric models that includes and simplify the assembly and composition. CasADi is a symbolic framework for numeric optimization implementing automatic differentiation in forward and reverse modes on sparse matrix-valued computational graphs. It supports self-contained C-code generation and interfaces state-of-the-art codes such as SUNDIALS, IPOPT etc. It can be used from C++, Python or Matlab/Octave. ADMSL is the Algorithmically Differentiated (AD) version of a part of the Modelica standard package.
