## Roadmap stages

 Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving optimization and control tasks in Modelica models. ADMSL is the Algorithmically Differentiated (AD) version of a part of the Modelica standard pack. iGeo: Computational Design and 3D Modeling Library for Processing. ModelFLOWs is a research group specializing in data analysis, reduced order modeling, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The Multidisciplinary-design Adaptation and Sensitivity Toolkit (MAST) is a sensitivity-enabled, multiphysics FEA tool developed to support computational design and engineering analysis. DrivAerNet++ covers all conventional car designs. Archimedes is a free and open source CAD (Computer Aided Design) software. Manyfold is an open source, self-hosted web application for managing a collection of 3d models, particularly focused on 3d printing. BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source combinatorial solid modeling system. CADmelia is an open-source CAD tool for creating 3D CAD models. Chili3D is an open-source 3D CAD software that runs directly in modern web browsers. CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for building parametric 3D CAD models. CADCloud is a cloud based sharing infrastructure dedicates to CAD engineers. The FreeCAD MCP (Model Control Protocol) provides a simplified interface for interacting with FreeCAD through a server-client architecture.
