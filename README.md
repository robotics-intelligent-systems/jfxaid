## Roadmap stages

GPkit is a Python package for defining and manipulating geometric programming models, abstracting away the backend solver. Omniverse Blueprint for Real-time Computer-aided Engineering Digital Twins. OpenUSD Exchange SDK accelerates OpenUSD adoption by helping developers design, build, and test their own USD I/O solutions, producing consistent and correct USD assets across diverse 3D ecosystems. The AI 3D Generator is a FreeCAD plugin that integrates OpenAI's powerful language models to generate and execute 3D models through AI-driven code generation. Synthesis is a Robotics Simulator for Autodesk Fusion CAD Designs. The NVIDIA (DALI) is a GPU-accelerated library for data loading and pre-processing to accelerate deep learning applications. Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL). ADMSL is the Algorithmically Differentiated (AD) version of a part of the Modelica standard pack. ModelFLOWs is a research group specializing in data analysis, reduced order modeling, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The Multidisciplinary-design Adaptation and Sensitivity Toolkit (MAST) is a sensitivity-enabled, multiphysics FEA tool developed to support computational design and engineering analysis. DrivAerNet++ covers all conventional car designs. BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform combinatorial solid modeling system. CadQuery is an intuitive module for building parametric 3D CAD models. CADCloud is a cloud based sharing infrastructure dedicates to CAD engineers.
